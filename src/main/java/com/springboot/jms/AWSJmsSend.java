 * This sample demonstrates how to make basic requests to Amazon SQS using the

 * <p>
 * <b>Prerequisites:</b> You must have a valid Amazon Web
 * Services developer account, and be signed up to use Amazon SQS. For more
 * information on Amazon SQS, see http://aws.amazon.com/sqs.
 * <p>
 * Fill in your AWS access credentials in the provided credentials file
 * template, and be sure to move the file to the default location
 * (~/.aws/credentials) where the sample code will load the credentials from.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> To avoid accidental leakage of your credentials, DO NOT keep
 * the credentials file in your source directory.
